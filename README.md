to understand user queries and provide relevant information on visa types, requirements, and processes.
In short, our chatbot provides a convenient and efficient way for users to obtain visa-related information and guidance.

Tech Stack:
1) Machine Learning:
We have built a very basic NLP chatbot using NLTK which can answer basic queries related to Visa requiremnnts, types and processes. The chatbot is trained 
on a text file in which the data is gathered from the Ministry of External Affairs(MEA) website.
Libraries Used : <br>
a) NLTK
b) TensorFlow
2) Front-End Development:
We have used HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript to create a basic ChatBot UI.
3) Backend Development : 
Flask framework is used for the backend part of the chatbot and is connected to the Frontend part.
